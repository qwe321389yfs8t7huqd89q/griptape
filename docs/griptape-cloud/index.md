# Griptape Cloud

[Griptape Cloud](https://cloud.griptape.ai/) provides managed services for your AI app stack. Deploy and scale end-to-end solutions, from LLM-powered data prep and retrieval to AI Agents, Pipelines, and Workflows.

## Build Your Own RAG Pipeline
Connect to your data with our [Data Sources](data-sources/create-data-source.md) and prepare them for retrieval with [Knowledge Bases](knowledge-bases/create-knowledge-base.md).

## Host and Run Your Code
Have Griptape code? Have existing code with another LLM framework? You can host your Python code using [Structures](structures/create-structure.md) whether it uses the Griptape Framework or not.

## APIs
All of our features can be called via API with a [Griptape Cloud API Key](https://cloud.griptape.ai/configuration/api-keys). See the [API Reference](api/api-reference.md) for detailed information.
