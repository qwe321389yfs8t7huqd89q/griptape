# Structures

Structures are a primary component in Griptape for organizing and executing Tasks against a LLM.

## Create a Structure

1. [Connect Your GitHub Account in your Griptape Cloud account](https://cloud.griptape.ai/account)
1. Install the [Griptape Cloud GitHub app to your GitHub account or organization](https://github.com/apps/griptape-cloud/installations/new/)
    - Be sure to allow the app access to `All Repositories` or select the specific repositories you need
1. Ensure your repository has a Structure Config YAML file
    - To learn more see [Structure Config YAML](structure-config.md)

You can now [create a Structure in the Griptape Cloud console](https://cloud.griptape.ai/structures/create) by providing your GitHub repository information.
