# Knowledge Bases

Knowledge Bases are the way to organize and access your data ingested from [Data Sources](../data-sources/create-data-source.md). You can specify multiple Data Sources per Knowledge Base in order to access data ingested from different sources all in one place.

## Create a Knowledge Base

You can [create a Knowledge Base in the Griptape Cloud console](https://cloud.griptape.ai/knowledge-bases/create) by specifying which Data Sources you wish to include. Once created, you can [access your data](accessing-data.md).
